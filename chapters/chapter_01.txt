Chapter 1: New Eden

The year was 2178, and humanity had finally found a new home in the distant reaches of the galaxy. The once blue skies of Earth were now a distant memory, replaced by a perpetual haze of smoke and ash from the countless wars over resources. But on the planet of Nova Terra, a beacon of hope shone bright.

New Eden was the largest metropolis in the solar system, built as a sanctuary for those who had fled the dying Earth. The city sprawled across the continent, its towering spires and grand architecture a testament to human ingenuity and resilience. Towering skyscrapers made of a glittering metallic material known as duracrete pierced the sky like shards of glass, casting long shadows over the sprawling streets below.

Ava Morales stood at the edge of the city, gazing out at the endless expanse of New Eden's sprawl. Her dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, revealing piercing green eyes that seemed to bore into the soul. She was a 25-year-old engineer, renowned for her exceptional skills and razor-sharp mind.

Ava's thoughts were consumed by the mysterious energy readings emanating from an abandoned research facility on the outskirts of the city. The lab had been shut down decades ago due to reports of strange occurrences and equipment malfunctions. But Ava was not one to believe in rumors or superstition. She saw only science, and she was determined to uncover the truth behind the strange energy signatures.

As she stood there, lost in thought, a sleek black hovercar appeared at her side, its engines humming softly. The car's AI, an androgynous voice known as S.A.R.A., spoke up.

"Ava Morales, your ride is here."

Ava smiled wryly, knowing that S.A.R.A. was more than just a car's AI. She was a loyal companion, always ready to lend a helping hand or provide sage advice when needed.

"Thanks, S.A.R.A.," Ava replied, opening the door and sliding inside. "I'm on my way to meet Dr. Patel."

The hovercar took off, swooping down towards the city's central square where Dr. Patel was waiting for her. The elderly scientist, a brilliant mind in his own right, was known for his eccentric behavior and unorthodox methods.

As they descended into the city, Ava spotted a group of heavily armed men watching them from across the square. Their faces were obscured by masks, but their eyes gleamed with an intensity that made Ava's skin crawl.

"S.A.R.A., who are those guys?" Ava asked, her voice low and even.

"Unidentified entities, Ava," S.A.R.A. replied, her tone neutral. "They seem to be tracking your movements."

Ava's grip on the seat tightened, a sense of unease creeping over her. She had never encountered these men before, but she knew that in New Eden, everyone was connected somehow.

The hovercar landed with a soft thud, and Ava stepped out onto the pavement. Dr. Patel was waiting for her, his wild white hair blowing gently in the breeze.

"Ah, Ava! I'm so glad you're here," he exclaimed, beaming at her. "I've made some incredible discoveries. Come see!"

Ava followed him into the research facility, a vast underground complex filled with rows of humming servers and blinking screens. The air was thick with the scent of ozone and burning circuits.

As they walked deeper into the lab, Ava noticed that the energy readings she had detected earlier were growing stronger by the minute. It was as if something was stirring beneath their feet, something ancient and powerful.

Dr. Patel stopped in front of a large console, his eyes shining with excitement.

"This is it, Ava! The discovery of a lifetime!"

But before he could reveal what that was, a loud alarm blared through the speakers, echoing off the walls.

"What's going on?" Ava asked, her voice sharp with concern.

Dr. Patel's face went pale.

"It seems we have company," he whispered, his eyes darting towards the exit.

As they turned to flee, Ava saw them: the masked men from across the square, their faces twisted in snarls of rage and fear.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, everything went black.

When Ava came to, she was lying on a cold metal table, her head throbbing with pain. Dr. Patel was nowhere to be seen, but S.A.R.A.'s voice echoed in her mind.

"Ava, wake up! We have to get out of here – now!"

Ava's eyes fluttered open, and she saw that she was surrounded by the masked men. Their faces were closer than before, their eyes blazing with a malevolent intensity.

And then, just as she was about to scream, everything went white again.

When Ava came to for the second time, she found herself in a dark, cramped room with no visible exit. A single light flickered above her head, casting eerie shadows on the walls.

A small note was attached to the wall, scrawled in hasty handwriting:

"You shouldn't have come here, Ava Morales."

As Ava read the words, the lights flickered and died, plunging her into darkness.

And that's when she heard it – a low hum, growing louder by the second. It was the energy signature, and it was coming for her...
