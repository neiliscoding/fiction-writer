Chapter 6: The Shadows Within (Continued)

Maya's eyes locked onto the duplicate Dr. Kim, her mind racing with desperation. She knew they had to escape, but every instinct screamed at her to stay frozen in place. Jax, sensing her hesitation, took a step forward, his hand still grasping for hers.

"Come on," he whispered urgently. "We can't let her trap us."

Maya nodded, her fingers intertwining with Jax's as they made a break for the door. The duplicate Dr. Kim didn't move, her eyes fixed on Maya like a predator stalking its prey. Maya felt a shiver run down her spine as she realized that this was more than just a simple duplication of DNA â€“ it was something alive.

As they burst through the door, Maya saw that they were back in the dimly lit corridors of Dr. Kim's office building. But everything seemed different now. The air was thick with an electric charge, and the shadows seemed to writhe like living things.

"Where are we going?" Jax asked, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

Maya hesitated, her mind racing with the possibilities. "I don't know," she admitted, "but I think Dr. Kim knows exactly where we're going."

The corridors seemed to twist and turn, leading them deeper into the heart of the building. Maya's skin crawled as she realized that they were being herded towards some unknown destination.

Suddenly, the lights flickered and died, plunging them into darkness. Maya felt Jax's hand tighten around hers, his grip like a vice. "What's happening?" he whispered.

Maya didn't answer. She knew that in this darkness, anything was possible. And she was willing to do whatever it took to escape.

As they stumbled forward, their hands outstretched like blind people, Maya felt the air around her begin to distort and ripple. The shadows seemed to coalesce into something solid, something that pressed against them with an unseen force.

"What's coming?" Jax whispered, his voice barely audible over the pounding of Maya's heart.

Maya didn't answer. She knew that in this moment, she was staring into the face of terror itself. And she was not prepared.

The darkness seemed to swell and grow, until it became a living, breathing thing that wrapped around them like a shroud. Maya felt Jax's hand slip from hers, and for a moment, she was alone.

And then, everything went white.
