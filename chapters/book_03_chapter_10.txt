I'd be happy to help you write Chapter 10! However, I need more information about the story and its plot. Could you please provide me with some context and details about what's happening in the story so far? What are Lyra's goals and motivations, and what challenges are they facing? Also, are there any specific themes or genres that you'd like to explore in this chapter?

Once I have a better understanding of the story, I can help you write a compelling Chapter 10.
