**Chapter 12:**

The ship's engines hummed to life, and Kae felt a sense of satisfaction as he worked on repairing the damaged fuel tank. His hands moved with precision, his eyes scanning the complex machinery for any signs of malfunction.

As he worked, Kae couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The crew had been quiet all morning, their usual banter and chatter replaced by an eerie silence. He tried to focus on his work, but his mind kept wandering back to the previous expedition's catastrophic failure.

"Kae?" Dr. Zhang called out from across the ship.

He looked up, a hint of annoyance creeping into his voice. "Yeah?"

"What have you found so far?"

"It's damaged, but I think I can repair it," Kae replied, gesturing to the complex machinery.

Dr. Zhang nodded, her expression serious. "Good work. But we need to move fast. The ship's life support is failing."

Kae's gut tightened as he followed Dr. Zhang to the engine room. Something was wrong, and he had a bad feeling about it.

As they arrived at the engine room, Kae saw that the crew was frantically working on repairs. "What happened?" he asked, his voice low.

Dr. Zhang hesitated before responding, "The ship's navigation system has malfunctioned. We're losing our course."

Kae's eyes widened as he realized the gravity of the situation. They were drifting through space, with no way to correct their course. The crew was doomed unless they could come up with a solution quickly.

Without hesitation, Kae sprang into action. He began frantically working on repairing the navigation system, his hands moving at lightning speed. The crew watched in awe as he worked, their faces etched with fear and determination.

As Kae worked, the ship's engines sputtered and died, plunging the room into darkness. The crew gasped in unison, their hearts racing with fear.

And then, just as suddenly, the lights flickered back to life, revealing a shocking sight: the ship was approaching an alien planet, its surface shrouded in a thick, impenetrable fog.

Kae's eyes widened as he realized the truth. They were not drifting through space - they had been pulled towards this planet all along.

The crew stared at Kae, their faces filled with confusion and fear. What did it mean? And what lay ahead for them on this mysterious alien world?

As the ship hurtled towards the planet's surface, Kae felt a sense of trepidation wash over him. They were walking into the unknown, with no idea what dangers or wonders lay in wait.

The fate of the crew hung in the balance, and Kae was determined to do everything in his power to keep them safe.
