**Chapter 4:**

The ship's corridors were eerily quiet, the only sound being the soft hum of life support systems and the occasional creak of metal as the vessel adjusted to its new trajectory. Dr. Zhang Wei stood in front of a bank of consoles, her eyes fixed intently on the data streaming across their screens.

"Dr. Zhang, we're experiencing some issues with our propulsion system," Kae's voice crackled over the comms system. "I'm trying to run diagnostics, but I need your expertise to troubleshoot."

Zephyr "Zeph" Jensen, the chief engineer, poked his head into the room. "Kae, can you give me a quick rundown of what's happening?"

Kae's response was immediate. "Fuel injectors are malfunctioning, and I'm not sure why. We need to get it fixed ASAP or we'll be stuck in orbit for months."

Zephyr nodded thoughtfully. "I think I see the problem. Dr. Zhang, can you walk us through what happened?"

Dr. Zhang turned from her console, a look of concentration on her face. "We experienced a minor malfunction in the fuel injection system due to a faulty sensor reading. It's now causing our propulsion systems to fail."

Zephyr rubbed his temples, feeling a headache coming on. "Okay, let's get to work then. Kae, can you patch up that injector while we figure out how to fix the sensor?"

As Zephyr turned to leave, he caught sight of Rye Jensen, the chief medical officer, standing in the doorway, watching them with an intensity that made him feel uncomfortable.

"Hey, Rye," Zephyr said, trying to break the tension. "What brings you here?"

Rye's expression remained neutral, but his eyes seemed to bore into Zephyr's very soul. "Just making sure everyone is okay, of course."

Zephyr nodded and turned back to Kae. "Alright, let's get started then. We've got a ship to fix."

As the team worked together to repair the malfunctioning propulsion system, tensions simmered beneath the surface. Zephyr couldn't shake the feeling that Rye was hiding something from him, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.

Meanwhile, Dr. Zhang continued to work her magic on the console in front of her, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tried to pinpoint the source of the problem. She knew that with this malfunction, their mission to explore the outer reaches of the galaxy could be jeopardized if they couldn't get it fixed soon.

The silence in the corridor seemed to grow thicker, like a fog rolling in off the horizon. It was as if the very universe itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

And then, without warning, everything changed.
