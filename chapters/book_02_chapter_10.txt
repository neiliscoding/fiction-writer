Here's a possible Chapter 10:

**Chapter 10: The Engineer's Gambit**

Lyra Erebus floated in zero gravity, their eyes fixed on the holographic display projected in front of them. The Maverick's Revenge was a hulking mass of scavenged parts and makeshift repairs, but Lyra had made it their own.

"Captain, I've got some bad news," Zephyr Vashin said, entering the room with a lopsided grin on their face.

"What is it?" Lyra asked, their fingers flying across the control panel as they worked to repair a damaged life support module.

"I hacked into the encrypted files from the old research station," Zephyr said, "and I think we've got something big."

Lyra's eyes narrowed. "What kind of thing?"

"Looks like it's some sort of prototype technology," Zephyr replied, their voice dripping with excitement. "I'm not sure what it does, but it's definitely not natural. It's been heavily modified, like someone tried to hide its true purpose."

Lyra's mind was racing. The Architects project had always been shrouded in mystery, and now they might have stumbled upon something that could change everything.

"Let me see," Lyra said, walking over to the holographic display and taking a closer look at the encrypted files.

As they worked to crack the code, Lyra couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. The Maverick's Revenge was a small ship, but it had been attacked by hostile forces more times than they could count. It was as if someone - or something - was waiting for them to uncover this secret technology.

Suddenly, the comms system beeped, signaling an incoming transmission from an unknown source.

"Who is this?" Lyra asked, their voice firm and wary.

The response was immediate. "You're meddling in affairs that don't concern you, Lyra Erebus," a smooth, baritone voice said. "Leave the prototype alone, or we'll make sure you regret it."

Lyra's eyes locked onto Zephyr's. "It sounds like someone wants to buy us out. Literally."

Zephyr grinned. "Time to play their game, Lyra. Let's see what they're willing to pay for our troubles."

Without hesitation, Lyra activated the comms system and began negotiating with the unknown party. They knew it was a risk, but sometimes you had to take a gamble to uncover the truth.

As the negotiations continued, Lyra couldn't help but wonder: who were these people? And what did they want with this technology?

Only one thing was certain: Lyra Erebus was about to find out.
