Here's a possible start to Chapter 2:

**Chapter 2: "Rebirth"**

Lyra Erebus floated in zero gravity, their eyes fixed on the horizon of space as they gazed out at the endless expanse of stars. The Maverick's Revenge, their trusty ship, hummed along beside them, a steady heartbeat in the vast silence.

It had been months since Lyra joined the crew of the Maverick's Revenge. Months of navigating treacherous asteroid fields, repairing damaged systems, and surviving on scraps and salvaged parts. But despite the hardships, Lyra felt a sense of belonging they'd never experienced before.

The ship's AI, an amiable woman named Ada, spoke up from her console. "Lyra, we're approaching the coordinates for our next salvage mission. Prepare to receive the data package."

Lyra nodded, their gaze still fixed on the horizon. They loved this part of the job â€“ the thrill of discovery, the rush of adrenaline as they navigated the unknown.

As the data package downloaded onto the ship's mainframe, Lyra's eyes scanned the readings, searching for any signs of valuable cargo or hidden dangers. The Mavericks Revenge was a hodgepodge of salvaged parts and spare components, held together by wire, tape, and sheer determination.

But something caught Lyra's eye. A small, unassuming data packet, marked with a single symbol: <>

Lyra felt a shiver run down their spine as they accessed the packet. The contents were encrypted, but Lyra's quick mind worked through the code in mere seconds.

The message was simple: "Meet me on planet Delta-IV. Come alone."

Lyra's heart skipped a beat. Who could have sent this message? And what did they want?

As the ship entered Delta-IV's orbit, Lyra felt a sense of unease settle over them. This mission was about to take an unexpected turn.

**Mood:** Ominous, intriguing

**Visuals:** The stars outside the ship's windows, with a hint of the planet Delta-IV looming in the distance.
