Here is a new side character concept:

**Name:** Dr. Zhang Wei

**Role:** Chief Engineer of the research vessel "Aurora"

**Personality Traits:**

* Dr. Zhang is a brilliant but reclusive engineer who has spent most of her career studying the unique properties of exotic matter.
* She is fiercely independent and has a tendency to shut down when faced with social interactions or emotional connections.
* Despite this, she has a deep love for her work and will go to great lengths to ensure the success of the mission.

**Gender:** Non-binary (using they/them pronouns)

**Physical Appearance:** Dr. Zhang is slender and tall, with long, dark hair that falls down their back like a curtain. Their eyes are a warm, honey-brown color that seems to hold a deep kindness.

**Background:** Dr. Zhang was born into a family of engineers and always knew they wanted to follow in their footsteps. However, they struggled with the pressure to conform to societal expectations and instead turned towards research as a way to express themselves freely.

**Note:** Dr. Zhang's background makes them somewhat expendable due to their reclusive nature. They are an expert in their field but may not be as comfortable working in close quarters or forming close relationships with their teammates. This could put them at risk of being overlooked or underutilized by the team, who might not recognize the depth of their skills or the danger they pose.

Dr. Zhang's expertise is invaluable to the mission, but their tendency to shut down when faced with social interactions or emotional connections could also make them a liability in high-stress situations. Their independence and self-sufficiency may also lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications with their teammates.

This chapter should be told from the perspective of: Dr. Zhang Wei
