I'd be happy to help you write Chapter 8! However, I don't see a previous chapter in our conversation. Could you please provide me with the next step or the details about what Chapter 8 should cover?

If we're starting from scratch, here's a possible outline for Chapter 8:

**Chapter 8: The Mysterious Signal**

* Introduce a mysterious signal that has been detected by the space station's advanced sensors
* Describe the implications of this discovery and how it affects the crew
* Show Kae's expertise as they work to analyze and understand the signal
* Raise questions about the origin and purpose of the signal, setting up potential plot twists

Please let me know if you have any specific ideas or directions in mind for Chapter 8. I'll do my best to help you craft a compelling narrative!
