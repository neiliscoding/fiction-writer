Here is a new chapter:

**Chapter 7: The Ship's Log**

I sat in front of my console, sipping on a cup of lukewarm coffee, and stared at the screen in front of me. The ship's log was still open from the previous day's entry, but I hadn't had a chance to update it yet.

As I scrolled through the entries, I noticed that our last communication with Earth had been...unsettling. The messages we received were cryptic and vague, with no clear indication of what was happening on the other side of the galaxy.

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I read through the logs again. It was as if someone - or something - was watching us from the shadows, waiting for us to make our move.

"Kae, can you hear me?" Dr. Saeed's voice interrupted my thoughts.

"Yes, Doc," I replied, not looking away from the screen. "I'm right here."

"I need you to check on the ship's systems again," she said, her tone laced with a hint of urgency. "We're experiencing some strange readings coming from the engines."

I nodded, even though she couldn't see me. "I'm on it, Doc. I'll check everything out and make sure we're good to go."

As I began to scan through the ship's systems, I noticed something that made my heart skip a beat.

"Kae, come take a look at this," Dr. Jensen called out from across the room.

I quickly got up and walked over to his console. "What've you got?"

He pointed to the screen in front of him. "It looks like someone - or something - is trying to hack into our systems."

My eyes widened as I took a closer look at the code on the screen. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before.

"What do you think it means?" Dr. Jensen asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

I shook my head. "I don't know, but I think we need to investigate further."

The three of us sat in silence for a moment, staring at the screen as the tension in the room grew thicker and more oppressive.

And then, without warning, everything went black.

The lights flickered once, twice, and then died completely. The ship's systems went into lockdown mode, and we were plunged into darkness.

"Kae?" Dr. Saeed called out, her voice laced with panic.

"I'm here," I replied, my heart racing in my chest. "Everyone's accounted for."

But as I looked around the room, I realized that something was off. The ship's systems were still functioning, but it was like someone had taken over our control panel and was using us.

"Kae?" Dr. Jensen called out again.

This time, his voice was laced with fear.

"What is it?" I asked, my heart racing in my chest.

"I think we're under attack," he replied, his voice barely above a whisper.

And then, without warning, the ship's intercom crackled to life.

"Welcome aboard," a voice said. "You'll never leave this ship alive."

I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized that we were in grave danger.

The ship was under attack, and it was up to us to figure out who - or what - was behind it.

But as I looked around the room at my crewmates, I knew that we were in for a fight.

And not just any fight. A fight for survival.
