**Chapter 4: The Engineer's Dilemma**

Kae Vex gazed out at the stars, his mind whirling with calculations and equations as he tried to repair the damaged engines of the Nova Spire. It was a tedious task, one that required patience and attention to detail, but Kae was up for the challenge.

As chief engineer of the auxiliary vessel, Kae's skills were essential to keeping the ship running smoothly. But in this moment, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was just spinning his wheels. The damage was too extensive, and the resources were limited.

Just as Kae was about to give up for the day, his comms device beeped, signaling an incoming message from Captain Orion himself.

"Kae, we've got a problem," the captain's voice crackled over the intercom. "The Nova Spire's sensors have picked up a hostile vessel closing in on our position. We need you to get the engines online ASAP."

Kae groaned inwardly. He knew that ship, and it wasn't friendly.

"Captain, I'll do my best," Kae replied, trying to keep his tone even. "But we can't outrun them for long. We're running on fumes here."

"I know, Kae. But we have to try. Get to work, and make it happen."

Kae nodded, even though the captain couldn't see him. He got back to work, his hands flying across the control panel as he frantically worked to repair the engines.

But as he worked, Kae's mind kept wandering back to a nagging question: if they couldn't outrun the hostile vessel, what other options did they have? And what would happen if they failed?
