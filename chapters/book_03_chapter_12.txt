Here's a potential side character concept:

Name: Dr. Elara Vex

Role: Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the research vessel "Aurora's Hope"

Personality Traits:
- Highly intelligent and analytical, but also intensely emotional and empathetic.
- Struggles with assertiveness and often prioritizes others' needs over her own.
- Has a dry sense of humor that can be awkward in tense situations.
- Is fiercely loyal to her crewmates, particularly the protagonist.

Gender: Non-binary (using they/them pronouns)

Why might be expendable:
As the CMO, Dr. Vex's primary role is to keep the crew healthy and safe. However, their expertise and loyalty make them a crucial asset to the team, but not necessarily a linchpin of the plot. If the story takes an unexpected turn or the protagonist becomes more self-sufficient in medical matters, Dr. Vex might be pushed into a secondary or supporting role, making them vulnerable to sacrifice if it advances the narrative.

Their non-binary identity adds another layer of complexity to their character, as they navigate the challenges of being an out LGBTQ+ individual in a predominantly heteronormative scientific community. This could create interesting dynamics and conflicts within the story.

Dr. Vex's expendability also raises questions about what makes someone valuable or essential to the plot. Are they just a minor supporting character, or do their contributions have a deeper impact on the story?

Here is the next chapter:

**Chapter 12:**

The lights in the medical bay flickered, and Dr. Elara Vex's eyes snapped up from the data screen in front of them. "What's going on?" they asked the AI, their voice low and even.

"Engine failure, CMO," the AI replied, its tone neutral. "One of the life support modules is experiencing a critical malfunction."

Dr. Vex's heart sank. They had been trying to repair the module for hours, but it seemed like every solution they came up with ended in failure. They knew they couldn't keep this up for much longer.

"Get the backup generator online," Dr. Vex instructed the AI. "We need to stabilize the system before we can try to fix it."

The AI nodded and set to work, its processes humming as it worked to bypass the malfunctioning module. Dr. Vex watched anxiously, their hands clenched into fists as they waited for the backup generator to kick in.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the lights in the medical bay stabilized, and Dr. Vex let out a deep breath. "Good," they said, their voice gruff with relief. "Now we can try to fix this thing once and for all."

But as they turned back to the data screen, Dr. Vex's heart skipped a beat. The malfunctioning module was not an isolated incident. There were multiple failures scattered throughout the ship's systems, each one more critical than the last.

Dr. Vex's eyes widened in horror as they realized that the ship was on the verge of catastrophic failure. They knew they had to act fast if they wanted to save their crewmates.
