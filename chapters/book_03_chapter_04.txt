Here's a potential Chapter 4:

**Chapter 4: The Aurora's Hope**

The stars streaked across the viewport like diamonds on black velvet, and the soft hum of the ship's engines provided a soothing background noise. Dr. Elara Vex leaned back in their chair, eyes fixed on the data streaming across their console. As Chief Medical Officer of the research vessel Aurora's Hope, they had been monitoring the ship's systems non-stop for days, searching for any sign of life or clues to the mysterious anomaly that had brought them here.

"Zee, what's the latest on our oxygen levels?" Dr. Vex asked, not looking up from their console.

Zara Patel, Chief Engineer and Maintenance Specialist, peered over her shoulder. "We're good for another 72 hours, Doc. The recycling units are running at optimal capacity."

Dr. Vex nodded, their eyes never leaving the data stream. "Good. We need to keep an eye on that oxygen levels if we want to make it back to civilization."

Just then, a voice crackled over the comms system. "Aurora's Hope, this is Mission Control. We've got some good news for you. Our team has made contact with the anomaly... they're hailing us now."

Dr. Vex's eyes snapped up from their console, and Zee followed suit. They exchanged a nervous glance - what did this mean? Were they really going to get answers, or was it just another trap set by the unknown entity that had brought them here?

The comms system crackled again, and a strange, pulsing light filled the viewport. Dr. Vex's eyes widened as they realized who was on the other end of the line.

"Hello?" Dr. Vex said, their voice hesitant.

The response came quickly, the words tumbling out in a rush. "We're... we're you. We've been watching you. We know what happened to your ship."

Dr. Vex's eyes narrowed. Who was this? And how did they know so much about their situation?

"Who are you?" Dr. Vex demanded, trying to keep their voice steady.

The response came again, slower and more measured this time. "We're... we're the survivors of a similar mission. We've been studying your ship's systems for months. We can help you fix it."

Dr. Vex's eyes met Zee's, and they exchanged a skeptical glance. Could they really trust these strangers? And what did they have to gain by helping them?

As the comms system crackled on, Dr. Vex made up their mind. They would listen to whatever this entity had to say - but only if it was safe.
