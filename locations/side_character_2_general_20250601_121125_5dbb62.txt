Here's a potential side character concept:

Name: Zephyr "Zee" Vashin

Role: Chief Engineer of the spaceship Aurora, responsible for maintaining the ship's systems and infrastructure.

Personality Traits: Zee is a no-nonsense, practical individual who values efficiency and effectiveness. They're fiercely loyal to their crewmates and will do whatever it takes to keep them safe. However, Zee has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know them.

Gender: Non-binary (they use they/them pronouns).

Note on Expendability: While Zee is an integral part of the crew, their role could be seen as somewhat expendable if it means saving the lives of other key characters. As chief engineer, Zee's expertise is crucial to keeping the ship operational, but if that expertise is lost, the crew can adapt and find alternative solutions. Additionally, Zee's practical nature might lead them to prioritize functionality over personal relationships, making them more willing to put themselves in harm's way for the greater good.

This character concept offers a unique perspective on the typical side character trope, as they're not necessarily tied to the main protagonist or antagonist, but are still an essential part of the crew.
