Here's a potential side character for your science fiction story:

**Name:** Zara "Zee" Vex

**Role:** Chief Engineer of the spaceship "Aurora"

**Personality Traits:**

* Zee is a brilliant, yet reclusive engineer with a passion for tinkering and inventing.
* She has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her.
* Despite this, she has a deep sense of loyalty and will go to great lengths to protect her crewmates.

**Gender:** Non-binary (using they/them pronouns)

**Appearance:** Zee is tall and slender, with short, spiky hair that's often dyed in bold colors. They have a collection of colorful tattoos on their arms and torso, which reflect their love of art and music.

**Background:** Zee grew up on a remote planet on the edge of the galaxy, where they learned to repair and maintain equipment from a young age. They joined the spacefaring community as soon as they were old enough, working their way up to become one of the most skilled engineers in the sector.

**Why Zee might be expendable:** As a non-essential character, Zee's skills could be replaced by other crew members if needed. If the ship is forced to evacuate due to an emergency, Zee's willingness to stay behind and repair critical systems might put them at risk of being left behind. Additionally, their reclusive nature might make it difficult for them to form close relationships with the rest of the crew, making them more of a liability in certain situations.

However, as a side character, Zee has the potential to be used in creative ways that wouldn't involve putting them in harm's way. For example, they could serve as a voice of reason and pragmatism within the crew, or provide comedic relief with their dry wit and sarcastic comments.
