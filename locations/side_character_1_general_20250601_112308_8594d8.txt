Here is a potential side character for your science fiction story:

Name: Kaelin "Kae" Vex

Role: Chief Engineer and maintenance specialist of the spaceship's infrastructure.

Personality Traits:
- Resourceful and practical, often relying on his wits to fix problems rather than relying on brute force.
- Has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times, but he is not mean-spirited.
- Loyal to those he considers friends, but has a hard time forming close relationships due to past experiences.

Gender: Male

Background:
Kae grew up on a remote planet, where he was forced to rely on his own abilities to survive. He became skilled at improvising repairs and maintenance using scavenged materials.

Why he might be expendable:
While Kae is an incredibly resourceful character, his skills are highly specialized and may not be as transferable to other situations. Additionally, his dry humor and sarcastic nature may make it difficult for him to connect with others who don't share his background or sense of humor. This makes him vulnerable in certain situations where he needs to form alliances or rely on others for support.

As a bonus, Kae has a personal stake in the mission - he was part of a previous expedition that went catastrophically wrong and left many people dead. He is haunted by guilt and feels responsible for the failure, which can cause him to question his own abilities and second-guess himself at critical moments.
