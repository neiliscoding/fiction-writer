Backstory:

Lyra was born on the outer rim planet of Tartarus-IV, where their family lived a nomadic lifestyle as scavengers. From a young age, Lyra demonstrated an uncanny talent for fixing broken machinery and understanding complex systems. As they grew older, Lyra became fascinated with the abandoned research stations and ruins left behind by the long-abandoned "Architects" project.

When Lyra's family ship was attacked and destroyed during a mission to salvage an ancient facility, they were forced to flee in escape pods. With no resources, skills, or connections left behind, Lyra became a solo operative, surviving on scraps and salvaged parts.

Years later, Lyra's reputation as a skilled engineer and navigator spread throughout the galaxy, earning them a spot as the chief engineer on the Maverick's Revenge, an aging salvage ship crewed by eccentric misfits. As Lyra navigates the dangers of space, they begin to unravel secrets about their family's past, the Architects project, and the mysterious forces that seek to control the cosmos.

Physical Description: Lyra has short, spiky hair dyed in a subtle shade of indigo. Their eyes are an unsettling pale gray, with vertical pupils that seem almost... electronic. They wear worn, utilitarian clothing with scavenged patches and repairs, reflecting their practical, resourceful nature.

This character concept combines elements of intrigue, exploration, and resilience, with a dash of dry wit and vulnerability.
