Here's a potential side character concept:

**Name:** Zephyr "Zeph" Vashin

**Role:** Engineer and Inventor

**Personality Traits:**

* Resourceful and quick-thinking, with a talent for improvising solutions to complex problems.
* Loyal to those they trust, but can be aloof and standoffish towards others due to their introverted nature.
* Has a dry sense of humor and often uses sarcasm to deflect from deeper emotions.

**Gender:** Non-binary (they/them pronouns)

**Appearance:** Zephyr has short, spiky hair that's always styled in a messy, piecey fashion. Their eyes are an unsettling shade of indigo, which seems almost otherworldly. They favor functional clothing and have a habit of tinkering with gadgets and machinery.

**Background:** Zephyr grew up on the fringes of society, scavenging for parts and scraps to build their own inventions. As they honed their skills as an engineer, they became a go-to fixer for various factions within the sci-fi universe, taking on odd jobs and projects that often involved tinkering with advanced technology.

**Why Zephyr might be expendable:** Due to their background as a scavenger and fixer, Zephyr has made many enemies across the galaxy. Their skills are highly transferable, and they've worked for various factions with questionable motives. As a result, if they become too much of a liability or threaten someone's interests, they could be eliminated without hesitation. This makes them a potentially expendable asset in the eyes of those who might see them as a means to an end.

Zephyr's non-binary identity and background also make them somewhat of an outsider within the main cast, which could lead to interesting conflicts and dynamics as they navigate relationships with other characters.
