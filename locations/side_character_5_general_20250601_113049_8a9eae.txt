Here is a new side character concept:

**Name:** Ryder "Rye" Jensen

**Role:** Chief Medical Officer of the spacecraft "Aurora"

**Personality Traits:**

* Rye is a calm and collected individual, with a soothing presence that puts those around them at ease. However, beneath this fa√ßade lies a sharp intellect and a fierce determination to uncover the truth.
* He has a dry sense of humor, often using wit and sarcasm to deflect from his true feelings.
* Rye's past is marked by trauma, which he keeps hidden behind a mask of professionalism.

**Gender:** Male

**Physical Appearance:** Rye stands at around 6'2" with an athletic build. His short brown hair is always neatly trimmed, and his warm, hazel eyes seem to hold a depth of understanding that puts those around him at ease.

**Background:** Rye was born into a family of medical professionals and always knew he wanted to follow in their footsteps. However, after a tragic accident took the life of someone close to him, Rye became disillusioned with the medical establishment and turned his skills towards space exploration. He eventually landed on the Aurora as its chief medical officer.

**Note:** Rye's background makes him somewhat expendable due to his emotional baggage. His past trauma has left him emotionally scarred, and he may be more likely to retreat into himself when under pressure or experiencing stress. This could put him at risk of being overlooked or underutilized by the team, who might not recognize the depth of his feelings or the danger they pose.

Rye's medical expertise is invaluable to the team, but his emotional vulnerability could also make him a liability in high-stress situations. His tendency to keep people at arm's length might also lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications with his teammates.
