Here is a suggested side character for your science fiction story:

**Name:** Zephyr "Zeph" Vex

**Role:** Engineer and systems specialist for the spaceship's maintenance team.

**Personality traits:**

* Quick-witted and resourceful, often improvising solutions to complex problems.
* Confident in their expertise, but occasionally comes across as arrogant or dismissive of others' opinions.
* Has a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times.
* Values independence and freedom above all else.

**Gender:** Non-binary (using they/them pronouns).

**Brief note on expendability:** Zephyr's skills are highly specialized, but not necessarily critical to the overall mission. They're an expert in ship systems, but their expertise is mostly confined to maintenance and repairs. If the main character were to be stranded or separated from the rest of the crew, Zephyr might be the first to be left behind or sacrificed for the greater good, as they wouldn't be essential to the immediate survival of the team.

This side character's expendability could create tension and conflict within the group, making them a more nuanced and interesting addition to your story.
