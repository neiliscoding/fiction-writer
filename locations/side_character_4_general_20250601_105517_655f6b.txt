Here's a suggestion for a side character in a science fiction story:

Name: Elara Vex

Role: Chief Engineer of the research vessel "Aurora's Hope"

Brief Note: Elara is a brilliant and resourceful engineer who has been with the crew since the early days of their mission. She's responsible for maintaining the ship's systems, repairs, and upgrades. Despite her expertise, she's often overlooked by the other crew members, who view her as "just" an engineer rather than a valuable member of the team.

Why Elara might be expendable: While Elara is incredibly skilled and has saved the crew from multiple critical situations, she has a secret that makes her more vulnerable to exploitation. She's been suffering from a rare genetic disorder that affects her immune system, making her more susceptible to infections and diseases. As the mission progresses and the stakes grow higher, it becomes increasingly likely that Elara will be forced to make difficult choices or face risks that put her health at risk, potentially making her expendable in order to protect the rest of the crew.

This setup creates an interesting dynamic where the protagonist is torn between their loyalty to Elara and their duty to protect themselves and the rest of the crew.
