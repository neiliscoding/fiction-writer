Here's a suggested side character for your science fiction story:

Name: Dr. Elianore Quasar

Role: Chief Engineer of the space station "Aurora's Hope", a research facility located in a distant corner of the galaxy.

Elianore is a brilliant and resourceful engineer who has been instrumental in maintaining the Aurora's Hope's life support systems, propulsion, and defense networks. However, Elianore's role as chief engineer makes them expendable for several reasons:

1. **Specialization**: Elianore is an expert in a specific area of engineering, making them less versatile than other crew members who can handle multiple tasks.
2. **Dependence on systems**: The success of the Aurora's Hope heavily relies on its advanced technology and infrastructure, which Elianore has spent years maintaining. If they were to be injured or incapacitated, it could compromise the entire station's operations.
3. **Perceived safety net**: As a key member of the engineering team, Elianore might be seen as an easy target for elimination by villains seeking to disable or sabotage the Aurora's Hope. Their expertise and resources make them a convenient choice for adversaries looking to gain leverage over the crew.

Elianore is a skilled but vulnerable character who could serve as a sacrifice for the greater good of the story, highlighting the risks and sacrifices made by those in positions of importance within the Aurora's Hope.
