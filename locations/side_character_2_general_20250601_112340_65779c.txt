Role: Chief Engineer of the research vessel "Aurora"

Personality Traits:

* Dr. Zhang is a brilliant but reclusive engineer who has spent most of her career studying the unique properties of exotic matter.
* She is fiercely independent and has a tendency to shut down when faced with social interactions or emotional connections.
* Despite this, she has a deep love for her work and will go to great lengths to ensure the success of the mission.

Gender: Non-binary (using they/them pronouns)

Brief Note on Expendability:

Dr. Zhang's unique expertise is essential to the mission, but their reclusive nature makes them difficult to get along with. If the team encounters a problem that requires a high degree of emotional intelligence or empathy, Dr. Zhang may be less effective in resolving it. Additionally, if the research vessel is severely damaged and resources are scarce, Dr. Zhang's personal safety may become a liability if they're deemed expendable due to their skills being more valuable on the ship than off it.
