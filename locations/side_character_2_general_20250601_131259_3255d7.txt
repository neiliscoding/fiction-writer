Name: Dr. Elara Vex

Role: Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the research vessel "Aurora's Hope"

Personality Traits:
- Highly intelligent and analytical, but also intensely emotional and empathetic.
- Struggles with assertiveness and often prioritizes others' needs over her own.
- Has a dry sense of humor that can be awkward in tense situations.
- Is fiercely loyal to her crewmates, particularly the protagonist.

Gender: Non-binary (uses they/them pronouns)

Why might be expendable:
As the CMO, Dr. Vex's primary role is to keep the crew healthy and safe. However, their expertise and loyalty make them a crucial asset to the team, but not necessarily a linchpin of the plot. If the story takes an unexpected turn or the protagonist becomes more self-sufficient in medical matters, Dr. Vex might be pushed into a secondary or supporting role, making them vulnerable to sacrifice if it advances the narrative.

Their non-binary identity adds another layer of complexity to their character, as they navigate the challenges of being an out LGBTQ+ individual in a predominantly heteronormative scientific community. This could create interesting dynamics and conflicts within the story.

Dr. Vex's expendability also raises questions about what makes someone valuable or essential to the plot. Are they just a minor supporting character, or do their contributions have a deeper impact on the story?
