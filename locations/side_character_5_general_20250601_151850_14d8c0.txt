Name: Kaelin "Kae" Vex

Role: Chief Engineer of the space station's maintenance crew

Personality Traits: Kae is a skilled but reclusive engineer with a dry sense of humor and a tendency to keep people at arm's length. They are fiercely loyal to their colleagues and will go to great lengths to ensure the safety of those they care about.

Gender: Non-binary (using they/them pronouns)

Why they might be expendable: Kae's isolation and lack of close relationships make them vulnerable to emotional manipulation by villains or other antagonists. Additionally, as a skilled engineer, they may have access to critical systems that could be used against the main characters if they are compromised.

Physical appearance: Kae has short, spiky hair that is often hidden under a helmet or headscarf, and their features are obscured by thick-framed glasses and a perpetual air of exhaustion. They wear functional clothing and have a habit of carrying a toolbox with them wherever they go.

Background: Kae grew up on a remote planet on the edge of the galaxy, where resources were scarce and people relied on each other for survival. As a result, they developed a strong sense of self-reliance and a willingness to take risks that might be seen as reckless by others. Despite their tough exterior, Kae has a deep emotional scar from a past loss and struggles to form close relationships.

This character concept offers a unique blend of technical expertise, emotional depth, and vulnerability, making them an intriguing addition to your science fiction story.
