I love Kae's concept! Here's an alternative side character idea:

**Name:** Dr. Zara Saeed

**Role:** Chief Medical Officer of the spacecraft "Aurora"

**Personality Traits:**

* Zara is a compassionate and empathetic doctor, but also fiercely analytical and detached.
* She has a dry, sarcastic sense of humor that can be biting at times.
* Despite her professional demeanor, Zara has a deep-seated fear of failure and the weight of responsibility that comes with being the team's medical officer.

**Gender:** Female (she/her pronouns)

**Physical Appearance:** Zara is slender and tall, with long, dark hair that falls down her back like a curtain. Her eyes are a warm, honey-brown color that seems to hold a deep kindness.

**Background:** Zara was born into a wealthy family, but she always felt stifled by the expectations placed upon her. She turned to medicine as a way to make a difference in people's lives and prove herself on her own terms.

**Note:** Zara's background makes her somewhat expendable because of the high-stakes nature of her work. As the team's medical officer, she is responsible for keeping everyone alive, which means that if anything goes wrong, she could be the one to suffer the consequences. Additionally, her family's wealth and influence also create a sense of distance between Zara and the rest of the team, making it harder for them to form close bonds with her.

This character concept plays off the idea that those who are responsible for keeping others alive can become expendable in the heat of battle. It also adds an interesting dynamic to the story, as Zara's high-stakes work creates tension and conflict within the team.
