Here's a new suggestion for a side character in your science fiction story:

**Name:** Dr. Elara Vex

**Role:** Chief Engineer of the research vessel "Horizon's Edge"

Dr. Vex is responsible for maintaining and upgrading the ship's systems, including propulsion, life support, and advanced sensors. She's an expert in quantum mechanics and materials science, having completed her Ph.D. at a prestigious university.

**Why she might be expendable:** Dr. Vex was recruited by the Horizon's Edge crew on short notice due to a combination of factors. Her expertise is valuable, but also somewhat unusual compared to other members of the team. She has an unconventional approach to problem-solving and often relies on intuition over data-driven analysis, which can lead to interesting conflicts with the more traditional scientific minds on board.

Additionally, Dr. Vex's personal life is marked by a recent divorce and a tendency towards reckless behavior (she still owns a modified hoverbike). This makes her less likely to be emotionally invested in the crew or their mission, should things take a turn for the worse.

Dr. Vex's expendability also stems from her limited role within the story so far; she hasn't contributed directly to any major plot points, leaving room for her to become more integral to the narrative if needed.
