Name: Zara "Zee" Patel

Role: Chief Engineer of the spaceship Aurora's repair team

Personality Traits: Zee is a brilliant but reclusive engineer who has a tendency to get lost in her own thoughts and technical jargon. She is fiercely independent and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her. Despite this, she has a dry sense of humor and a deep love for ancient mythology.

Gender: Non-binary (using they/them pronouns)

Note on Expendability: As the chief engineer, Zee plays a crucial role in maintaining the ship's systems and repairs. However, their lack of social skills and tendency to withdraw into themselves make them vulnerable to emotional manipulation or coercion by those who seek to exploit their technical expertise for personal gain. Additionally, as a non-binary character, they may face prejudice or bias within the ship's hierarchy, making them an expendable asset in certain situations.

Zee's unique background and skillset would be wasted if they were promoted too high up the ranks or placed in positions of leadership, where their social awkwardness could hinder their ability to effectively manage teams. Instead, Zee remains a trusted but overlooked expert who is always at the ready to jump into action when needed.
