Here's a potential side character for your science fiction story:

Name: Arin Vexar

Role: Chief Engineer of the spaceship Aurora's auxiliary vessel, the Nexus

Personality Traits:

* Arin is a brilliant and resourceful engineer, but his cocky attitude can sometimes rub people the wrong way.
* He has a dry sense of humor that he uses to deflect from his deep-seated insecurity about his family's past.
* Despite his confidence in his technical abilities, Arin has a tendency to underestimate others' skills and expertise.

Gender: Male

Note on expendability: Arin is not an expendable character by design, but his role as the chief engineer of a smaller vessel means that he may be more likely to take risks or put himself in harm's way in pursuit of fixing critical systems. This could lead to him being sacrificed in order to save the rest of the crew if the situation becomes dire.

As a side character, Arin has a unique skillset and perspective that makes him valuable to the main cast, but he is not essential to the overall plot. If his ship were damaged beyond repair or he was unable to contribute significantly to the mission, it's possible that the crew might have to find an alternative solution without relying on his expertise. This could create tension between Arin and the rest of the crew, as well as opportunities for character development and growth as they work together to overcome the challenges ahead.
