Here's a suggestion for a side character in a science fiction story:

Name: Dr. Elara Vex

Role: Chief Scientist of the "Arkship" (a massive generation ship) and lead researcher on the ship's terraforming project.

Why she might be expendable: As the chief scientist, Elara is responsible for overseeing the terraforming project, which aims to create a habitable environment on a distant planet. However, the project is facing significant delays and setbacks due to funding constraints and conflicting opinions among the crew. If the ship's leadership decides that the project is no longer feasible or prioritizes other goals, Elara could be reassigned or even terminated.

This makes her expendable because she:

1. Has a high level of expertise, making her a valuable resource to any entity.
2. Is deeply invested in the terraforming project, which might make it difficult for her to adapt to new priorities.
3. Could potentially become a liability if she becomes too focused on the project and starts making decisions that put the entire crew at risk.

This setup allows for interesting conflicts and power struggles within the ship's leadership while also providing opportunities for Elara to grow as a character and explore themes of sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty.
