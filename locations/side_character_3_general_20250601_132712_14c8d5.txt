Here's a side character concept:

Name: Zara "Zee" Patel

Role: Chief Engineer and Maintenance Specialist of the spaceship Aurora

Personality Traits:

* Zee is a no-nonsense, practical individual who prioritizes functionality over aesthetics.
* She has a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know her.
* Despite her tough exterior, she has a soft spot for lost causes and underdogs.
* Zee is intensely curious and loves solving complex problems.

Gender: Non-binary (they/them pronouns)

Note on Expensibility: While Zee is an invaluable member of the Aurora's crew, their role as Chief Engineer makes them a crucial part of the ship's systems. However, if the story takes a turn where the ship is severely damaged or if Zee's skills are rendered obsolete by advanced technology, they might be expendable to keep the plot moving forward.

Zee's expertise and resourcefulness make them an asset to the crew, but their willingness to put themselves in harm's way to save others might also put them at risk. If the story requires a sacrifice or Zee becomes too valuable to continue with the narrative, it could be argued that they are expendable to keep the plot on track.

This character concept offers a unique blend of technical expertise, dry wit, and emotional depth, making them a compelling addition to your science fiction story.
