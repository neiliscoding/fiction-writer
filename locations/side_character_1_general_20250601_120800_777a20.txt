Here is a suggestion for a new side character in your science fiction story:

Name: Kaelin "Kae" Vex

Role: Chief Engineer of the spaceship Aurora's auxiliary vessel, the Nova Spire.

Personality Traits: Kae is a resourceful and practical individual who has a talent for improvising repairs with limited resources. He's fiercely independent and has a dry sense of humor that he uses to deflect from his true emotions. Despite this, he has a soft spot for those in need and will go out of his way to help those on the ship.

Gender: Male

Why Kae might be expendable: As a skilled engineer, Kae is crucial to the operation of the Nova Spire. However, if the story takes a dramatic turn and the ship is severely damaged or captured, it's possible that Kae could become expendable as a bargaining chip in negotiations with hostile parties. Alternatively, if the situation becomes desperate and resources are scarce, Kae might be sent on a solo mission to scavenge for parts or make repairs, leaving him vulnerable to attack.

Kae's expendability also stems from his somewhat unremarkable nature - he's not a high-ranking officer or a charismatic leader, but rather a skilled technician who keeps the ship running smoothly behind the scenes. This could make him an easy target for elimination if the plot demands it.
