Here's a potential side character for your science fiction story:

**Name:** Zephyr "Zee" Vashin

**Role:** Chief Engineer of the space station or ship where the main characters are stationed.

**Personality Traits:**

* Zee is a brilliant but reclusive engineer who excels at solving complex technical problems.
* They have a dry sense of humor and can come across as aloof or standoffish to those who don't know them.
* Despite their introverted nature, Zee has a deep passion for justice and will go to great lengths to help those in need.
* They are fiercely independent and non-conformist, often challenging authority when they think it's necessary.

**Gender:** Non-binary (uses they/them pronouns).

**Physical Description:** Zee is of average height with short, spiky hair that changes color depending on their mood. Their eyes are an unnerving shade of green that seems to gleam in the dark.

**Note on Expendability:**

Zee might be expendable because of their complicated past. In their previous life as a member of an underground resistance movement, Zee was forced to make difficult choices that led to some tragic consequences. This trauma has left them with emotional scars and a deep-seated need for control over their own destiny. As a result, they have become increasingly isolated from others, including the main characters.

While Zee's technical expertise is invaluable to the team, their fragile emotional state makes them a potential liability in high-pressure situations. If the stakes are too high or the situation becomes too chaotic, Zee might be forced to retreat into their shell and abandon ship – literally – to protect themselves from further emotional harm.

This could create an interesting dynamic where the main characters must navigate the consequences of Zee's actions (or lack thereof), while also trying to help them heal and find redemption.
